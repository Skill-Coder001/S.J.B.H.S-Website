        <P>Choosing a school for your child is a serious undertaking. We urge you to take time out to visit our school, meet our administrators and understand the particular ethos of St Joseph’s Boys’ High School.

            Founded by fathers of the Society of Jesus, a Roman Catholic order of priests, our school carries almost 500 years of pedagogic history. Jesuit educational institutions around the world groom pupils to become good citizens and valued members of society who will make a positive difference.

            We take our role as spiritual guides earnestly. Our education rests on inculcating sound moral values in a liberal and pluralistic atmosphere.We celebrate all festivals and hold an annual Harmony Week - with readings in multiple faiths.

            We are affiliated to the Council for Indian Secondary Certificate Examinations (CISCE), which offers the Std 10 ICSE exam (Indian Certificate of Secondary Education) and Std 12 ISC exam (Indian School Certificate). Please read more under Curriculum. Facilities and Resources</P><br><br>
        <p>Our school offers excellent academic instruction; our Board exam results are well above average and our students fare well in competitive exams. We strongly believe that a good education must give equal importance to co curricular and extra curricular activities. Every academic subject has a Club to explore the subject in-depth in a small group, and students can choose which club to join. We have annual festivals on science and technology such as Transcendence and Eukranium as well as commerce fest Bifrost which our senior students help organise and execute. Our Model United Nations (MUN) is in its 6th edition and highly regarded; our MUN team has travelled abroad to participate successfully. Phenomenon is our two-day cultural fest with interschool competitions in dance, music, photography, creative writing, debating and filmmaking among others. Please read more
            Co Curricular.

            Our school is well known for sporting achievements and many international sporting legends – in cricket, hockey, badminton and swimming – are from here. We allow our students to participate widely, and no subject teacher will grudge an extra class for catching up, to a sportsman. Please read more Sports.

            We share your concerns for safety and have an army of CCTV cameras in the school, monitored in our Principal’s office. Our staff is annually trained in POCSO and other guidelines and no classroom or area is completely sealed from view.

            We are grateful for your interest in our school. If you find the above is in sync with your aspirations for your child, please come visit us and take our admission form.

        <h1>Sports</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>St Joseph's has a long and glorious tradition of excellence in sports. Walk into school on any given day and you will see our sportsmen, kitted out, playing on the grounds or ready to travel for matches. Many international and national players have been groomed in these very grounds.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sporting technique and sportsmanship are inculcated from a very young age as we believe that the discipline from sports and the virtue of sportsmanship can be applied anywhere in life. So sport is given due recognition and importance in everyday school life. Physical Education teachers and coaches together ensure that Josephites of all ages get the best training and experience. Regular inter house and inter school matches are the groundwork for state and national level debuts. Each sport has a Club and coaches to extend full support; teamwork, communication, leadership and networking are some of the takeaways from joining a club.
            <br>
            <br>
        <h2>Cricket</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="cricket.jfif">
        <br><br>
        <p>Cricket is a very popular sport in our school, and we have a roster of international players - Rahul Dravid, Robin Utthappa and others - whose sporting careers were established here. The Loyola Sports Complex houses an indoor cricket pitch, testimony to the legendary status of the game in SJBHS. During the summer of 2015, the cricket grounds on MG Road saw an upgradation to turf pitches. Regular practice sessions begin with the summer camps and continue over the weekend, right through the year.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Hockey</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="hockey_pg.jfif">
        <br><br>
        <p>Our school is synonymous with India's national game – Hockey. We host two prestigious inter school hockey tournaments: the Eric Vaz Memorial Tournament (U-14) and the Centenary Hockey Shield (U-16) - in the month of July. These matches are keenly contested by Bangalore schools and are played in the city stadium. Our senior boys are allowed out for the finals, to watch and cheer. A number of Hockey champions - Vece Paes, Sandeep Somesh, Anil Aldrin and many others have represented India both at the national and international level.</p>

Coaching sessions, conducted by the Southern Blues Foundation (SBF), lays emphasis on endurance, flexibility, tactical training and goal keeping.</p>

        <p>In our school, every student has access to Multimedia Classrooms, modern Science Laboratories, multiple Audio Visual Rooms, Music rooms, Computer Labs and a Library with books, magazines and periodicals for all ages.
